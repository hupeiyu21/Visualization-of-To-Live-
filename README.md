# Visualization of "To-Live"

## Getting Started
double click huozhe.html

## Background
The reading of long texts and the viewing of films and dramas, which contain complex relationships and plots, have long been a problem. Since a large amount of information cannot be easily integrated by the viewer, we have chosen to create a tool based on the theoretical basis of computer visualisation to facilitate organisation of texts. To complete the construction of the storyline database for the novel "To live", we generated a knowledge graph. In the use of the knowledge graph, we filtered out invalid information. Afterwards, we built the Sankey diagram and the force map using D3.js.
